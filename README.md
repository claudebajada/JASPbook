# Learning Statistics with JASP: A Tutorial for Medical Students and Other Beginners

I am a lecturer at the Department of Physiology and Biochemistry at the University of Malta and give an introductory course in statistics to medical students (in their intercalated year). I have been using Learning Statistics with JASP for the past few years, however, students tend to feel that they cannot quite relate to all of the examples in the book. As a (very part time) project, I am trying to adapt the text to make all of the examples more relevant to medical students. I have started with this modest goal, however in the future, I may extend the content of the book to include other statistical tests that are commonly encountered in the medical literature.

In order to be as transparent as possible with the process, I would like to make it very clear that I do not do very well with tedious tasks. As a result, during this process I will be using quite a bit of aid from Generative AI (mostly GPT-4). I review all output and do my best to ensure accurcy. In any case, any errors that you may find are very much my own. Most of the good stuff in this text stems from Danielle Navarro (and the other authors).

The book is still a work in progress!

I would be happy with any comments and / or suggestions I am happy to hear them
